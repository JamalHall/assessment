It may be sporadic in the beginning as they are looking for a coach, but we should be able to have scrimmages and games with the other teams that have coaches.

                    <p class="text">We are looking to play in 1-2 tournaments before the summer.  We will gauge readiness and family schedules, but looking at the end of April (Spring Championship) and mid-May (Spring Finale). These dates are definitely not set, not-mandatory, but we view them as a great way to expose our kids to different levels of the sport from different cities/regions.</p>
