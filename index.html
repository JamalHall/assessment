            <p class="section-text">Play to learn, play to practice, and you will win when you play in games. Remember how much fun you had growing up when you used to just go outside and play with your friends? We advocate using the "compete to learn" approach to practice--it lets kids play and have fun while competing. This type of practice, using competitive drills, does a better job of preparing players to compete in real games. Technically, this is called transference. What you do in practice carries over into what you do in games.

                    <p class="card-text">Coach Samper has more than a decade of experience coaching youth as a developmental skills and team coach.  He grew up playing in Cleveland at a Div I school during the same time as Lebron James and played collegiately and professionally in the ABA and UBA.  He has run training camps for the Cleveland Cavaliers and Utah Jazz and, most recently, was Director of the LA Clippers Youth Basketball Program.  He has trained with the likes of Kyrie Irving, Al Jefferson, Kyle Korver, and many more top NBA talent.  Coach Samper works and resides in Santa Barbara, CA as a teacher at a local private school for elementary through middle school and is a 1:1 coach to many of the local kids across the city.  His forte is utilizing innovative tools for practical skills development while making every session, practice, and game a fun and rewarding experience.  Most importantly, his demeanor and positivity working with kids is completely in line with our Program Goals and Mission.  We are fortunate to have someone of his caliber in our small locale.
