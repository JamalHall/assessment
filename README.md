- User data is stored in MongoDB Atlas
- In order to view the Parent Portal, you must sign up or login
- This application is responsive and works perfectly on Phones, Tables, and Computer Screens

## Assessment

For this assessment, you will be asked to code a simple HTML landing page based on one of our designs.
You will be provided with the following:

- This repository, which includes a blank html, css, and javascript file where you will write your code.
- A design file using Figma, an online web development software we use for designs
- [Figma File](https://www.figma.com/file/5l22ti4pFgFKSnlA93ouM7/branch/bWXSVeZJBLDgog0ysvTWGT/LevelUp?node-id=22%3A3)
- An assets folder containing all of the images that are used in the design file, for your convenience.
- Also included in the assets folder is a minified copy of jQuery, which will be the only additional library you should use for this website.
- You should have all of the required assets you need for this project other than the font files, which have been purposely excluded but can be found [here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) and [here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Alfa+Slab+One)

### Instructions

Assessment Instructions:

1. Git test: Clone this repo. Use commits to show your work.
2. HTML/CSS Test: Code only the landing page (the one with the two children playing basketball in the header). If you have extra time, you can code the secondary Parent Portal page as well.
3. Javascript/jQuery Test: 1) Make it so that the header slides right every 5 seconds to reveal the alternate header (the picture of the children on the beach). 2) Create a modal popup that stickies to the center of the screen, prompting users to "Please enter your password". The modal should be toggleable by clicking outside of the modal, or in the X in the top left corner.
4. Mobile responsive test: The page should be mobile responsive and look appropriate on desktop, phone, and tablets.
5. Back-end Test: Allow only approved users with the password access to the Parent Portal page (as a reminder, this page does not need to be coded unless you have extra time). Use Node.js, PHP, or another backend language of your choice. Include instructions on how to run your code.
6. Database Test: Add back-end functionality for the "Stay updated" mailing list. Emails should be saved into some kind of database (Mongo DB, MySQL, text file, or other). Bonus points for sending a confirmation email.
7. Done? Upload to a personal Github/Bitbucket repo and share that link with us, or ZIP your code (including .git folder and any .env) and share it with us. Bonus point if you also deploy to a live website.
